# rounded_modal

## THIS PLUGIN IS NOW DEPRECATED

You can now properly use borders with the default implementation of `showModalBottomSheet`!

```dart
showModalBottomSheet(
  shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
     borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10.0),
  ),
  backgroundColor: Colors.white,
);
```

##

A custom implementation of `showModalBottomSheet`.

Instead of overriding the entire theme of the app (which caused problems in various parts of my app) as suggested by other solutions on "How to set rounded corners of a modal?", I decided to take a look at the implementation for `showModalBottomSheet` and find the problem myself. 

## Getting Started

Turns out that all that was needed was wrapping the main code for the modal in a Theme widget that contains the `canvasColor: Colors.transparent` trick. I also made it easier to customize the radius and the background color of the modal itself.

```Dart
import 'package:rounded_modal/rounded_modal.dart';

showRoundedModalBottomSheet(
   context: context,
   radius: 10.0,  // This is the default
   color: Colors.white,  // Also default
   builder: (context) => ???,
);
```
